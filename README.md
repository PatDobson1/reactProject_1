# reactProject_1

This site is part one in series of React 'test' applications created to highlight React skills.

The live site can be found at project1.patrickdobson.co.uk

This site is a simple one page app created using basic React with Webpack and JSX. It uses React class components, HTML5 & SCSS to create the look of a webpage in a single page application.

Because the site is 'basic' React, there are no extra modules used. The pages change based on menu clicks from children components and the state is 'raised' to the top level App where it is passed down into the Content component

The data for the code samples is a randomly generated JSON file from www.mockaroo.com
